            <article>
                <p>“I felt as if this project enhanced the community, our creativity and our self-esteem as humans that
                    all share the same earth and created a space to just be… even if it was just for a few hours;
                    sometimes that makes all the difference in a world filled with chaos.”</p>

                <p>Altered Book Program</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>“… In the altered books class, I wrote without editing or stopping for the first time. I realized how
                    very honest my writing became and I saw so many things that were in my heart and mind that I was
                    unwilling to look at. This pushed me to face my fears, move through them, and to come to amazing
                    places on the other side.”</p>

                <p>“Jesse from Pigeon Arts was wonderful to work with! I had a concept for our Martin Luther King, Jr.
                    Day of Service activity but was not sure how to implement it. Jesse made my vision a reality. She
                    had great ideas about what art materials to use as well as how to interact with children and adults
                    who have experienced trauma . . .”</p>
